# Project Overview

Hello, everyone. Welcome to my Github account. 

As a data and book nerd, I frequently spend hours exploring new books and reviewing reader feedback before purchasing or renting them. This takes a long time. Books regarding data and artificial intelligence (AI), one of the sexiest topics in the twenty-first century (a famous phrase that people often use to hype up this business), are becoming increasingly popular.

So I was wondering if there was a method to automatically gather hundreds of thousands of information and reader evaluations of books on any particular field (Data Science, for example) in order to determine what constitutes a book become good (as evidenced by reader ratings and feedback) and the general feelings that people have regarding the book. That is the impetus behind the effort.

Basically, this project has two functions.

| Function name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|[**get_books.py**](https://github.com/quochuy0706/Crawl_Data_Goodread/blob/master/get_books.py)| It allows you to crawl meta data from all books on a specific topic.|
|[**get_reviews.py**](https://github.com/quochuy0706/Crawl_Data_Goodread/blob/master/get_reviews.py)| It allows you to crawl all reader review from all books on any specified topic.|

I've included descriptions of each function below.
In addition, I developed an [**EDA_Data_science_books.ipynb**](https://github.com/quochuy0706/Crawl_Data_Goodread/blob/master/EDA_Data_science_books.ipynb) to display the data file after it was automatically gathered from the **_getbook.py_** function and visual and analyze some aspects extracted from these books' metadata.
