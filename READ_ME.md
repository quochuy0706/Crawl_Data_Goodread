# Project Overview

Hello, everyone. Welcome to my Github account. As a data and book nerd, I frequently spend hours exploring new books and reviewing reader feedback before purchasing or renting them. This takes a long time. Books regarding data and artificial intelligence (AI), one of the sexiest topics in the twenty-first century (a famous phrase that people often use to hype up this business), are becoming increasingly popular.

So I was wondering if there was a method to automatically gather hundreds of thousands of information and reader evaluations of books on any particular field (Data Science, for example) in order to determine what constitutes a book. become good (as evidenced by reader ratings and feedback) and the general feelings that people have regarding the book.

This project has two functions.

| Function name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|[**get_books.py**](https://github.com/quochuy0706/Crawl_Data_Goodread/blob/master/get_books.py)| It allows you to crawl meta data from all books on a specific topic.|
|[**get_reviews.py**](https://github.com/quochuy0706/Crawl_Data_Goodread/blob/master/get_reviews.py)| It allows you to crawl all reader review from all books on any specified topic.  |
